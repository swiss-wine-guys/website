  <h2>About us:</h2>  
  <p>
   The Swiss WIne Guys was born out of a simple idea: what does it take to share the world class wines of Switzerland with a wider audience here in the U.S.?
    The answer was, of course, to start our very own import business!
    A chance meeting in 2021 led to some very fortuitous meetings in 2022, which were then followed by even more fortuitous meetings in 2023.
    Now, two years since those first meetings, we are proud to say that we have some incredible Swiss wines available in the NYC area with plans to expand even further!

  <h2>Who We Are</h2>

  <h3>Ian LeBlanc - Founder/CEO</h3>
  <p>
    Ian is a full-time dad, certified professional snowboard instructor, and former NYC bartender.
    He discovered the beauty of Switzerland as a teenager visiting friends in a small town outside Geneva,
    but it wasn't until a visit to the legendary 'Fete de Vignerons' in 2019 that his appreciation (and love) for Swiss wine and winemaking culture really took root.
    Always approaching life with passion and dedication, his goal is to provide an avenue for people to discover their 'source', both in life and especially in their glass!
    For Ian, Swiss wines are synonymous with passion, creativity, respect, sustainability, and a hunger for experiencing the best of what life has to offer.

  <h2>What We Do:</h2>
  <p>
    We work to cultivate solid personal relationships with the winemakers we represent to ensure that we are bringing you wines of superior quality that are cultivated, harvested, and vinified with the utmost attention to detail and respect for the terroir.  We are also on hand to assist in the curation of Swiss wine-centered events either for private gatherings or promotions in and around NYC. If there is a particular wine or vineyard that you are looking to import either for yourself or for a private event we are more than happy to discuss how we can assist you. Contact us directly to learn about our current offerings and more!
